Fishing Buddy
-------------

 Yet another fishing support add-on. It's a combination of TackleBox,
 Impp's Fishing Info and a fishing outfit manager all rolled into one. I
 wrote it both to provide some functionality that was missing from all
 of the other fishing add-ons I was using and to learn to do add-ons.

 Features:
 - 'Easy Cast' lets you right-click to cast your line. Use the same mouse
   button for looting and casting. A double-click will force another cast early
 - 'Fish Watcher' lets you see the fish you've caught here before (or
   the fish that you've caught in the current session)
 - Display your current skill level and the time since you started fishing
 - Choose your fishing outfit and change into it easily
 - Support for automatically adding a lure to your fishing pole
 - Full Titan Panel support
 - myAddOns support
 - Preliminary support for tracking 'cycle fish' such as the Nightfin
   Snapper so you know when to go looking for them

 Example commands:
 /fishingbuddy or /fb
 toggle the display of the Fishing Buddy window
 /fb help
 print the list of Fishing Buddy commands 
 /fb switch
 wear your chosen fishing outfit, or change back

 There are two actual add-ons -- the second one, OutfitDisplayFrame,
 handles the pretty pane to set up your fishing outfit (it's next on
 the list to be made into something more general that anyone can use).
 The OutfitDisplayFrame addon can be safely left out if you have a
 preferred equipment manager.

 alt-clicking on an item in your outfit display will clear it

 Silly stuff:
 In addition to displaying the fishing bonus for your fishing outfit,
 it also displays your 'style points' as inferred from Draznar's
 Fishing FAQ (http://wow.toshimo.com/viewtopic.php?t=272).

 Thanks to the authors of:

Installation
------------

1. Unzip the 'FishingBuddyVERSION.zip' file
2. If your unzip program allows you to specify a location, then
   unzip it into the "Interface/AddOns" folder contained in your
   WoW folder (the location that WoW was installed)
3. If your unzip program doesn't let you specify the destination,
   then find your WoW folder (where it was installed) and drag
   the 'FishingBuddy' and 'OutfitDisplayFrame' folder into the
   'Interface/AddOns' folder.
